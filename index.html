            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">I'm Matthew Vinson, a third-year computer science student at the University of South Carolina. I'm very passionate about programming, 
                always challenging myself and pushing myself to take on bigger projects. I’ve been programming since my sophomore year in High School, starting off with simple java objectdraw games in CP1, 
                then the introduction to algorithms and data structures in AP computer science, which lead me to pursue computer science in college. Currently, I’m a Linux Product Support Engineer Intern at
                 SIOS Technology corporation, assisting customers deal with issue they may encounter with SIOS’s high-availability server clustering software. Outside of computer science, I enjoy lifting, 
                 jiu jitsu, and PC games. I will try my hardest to update this portfolio with my latest projects/announcements.</p>

                <p>My first project is this very webpage! The goal of this project is to create an online portfolio to better my chances of getting a soild job, and to learn some HTML and CSS along the way. 
                    This page will likely never be finished, as there will always be new CSS/HTML features I learn about that would better this project. To lauch this page, I used DigitalOceans Droplets, as they 
                    were they cheapest (blame them if you have poor connection, not me)</p>

                <p>Currently, I'm working with a group of three other peers to create an task management and calendar app that allows users to create tasks, sub-tasks, and calendar events, and share those with other 
                    users and check progress in real time. The app is being designed for IOS users and is being developed with swift and XCode. As of now, our team is focused on learning swift and getting familiar with 
                    XCode, completing weekly milestones and updates for the professor. I created the mock sign-up page below using Adobe XD, and working on a mock task-view page. Check back for weekly updates. </p>

                customer support cases, which includes contacting the customer, looking through logs to identify what went wrong, and providing a solution to the customer. Other responsibilities are 
                rehosting customer licenses, answering general questions, building reports for the team, and side-projects assigned to me. During my time here, I worked on a team of interns and new-hires 
                create a recovery kit utilizing SIOS’s pre-made infrastructure compatible with MongoDB, using Perl.
