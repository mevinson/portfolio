            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--about">I'm Matthew Vinson, a third-year computer science student at the University of South Carolina. I'm very passionate about programming, 
                always challenging myself and pushing myself to take on bigger projects. I’ve been programming since my sophomore year in High School, starting off with simple java objectdraw games in CP1, 
                then the introduction to algorithms and data structures in AP computer science, which lead me to pursue computer science in college. Currently, I’m a Linux Product Support Engineer Intern at
                 SIOS Technology corporation, assisting customers deal with issue they may encounter with SIOS’s high-availability server clustering software. Outside of computer science, I enjoy lifting, 
                 jiu jitsu, and PC games. I will try my hardest to update this portfolio with my latest projects/announcements.</p>

                    This page will likely never be finished, as there will always be new CSS/HTML features I learn about that would better this project. To lauch this page, I used DigitalOceans Droplets, as they 
                    were they cheapest (blame them if you have poor connection, not me)</p>

            <p class="section__subtitle section__subtitle--work">My role at SIOS Technology Corporation is a Product Support Engineer Intern on the Linux team. My main responsibility is handling 
                customer support cases, which includes contacting the customer, looking through logs to identify what went wrong, and providing a solution to the customer. Other responsibilities are 
                rehosting customer licenses, answering general questions, building reports for the team, and side-projects assigned to me. During my time here, I worked on a team of interns and new-hires 
                develop a recovery kit utilizing SIOS’s pre-made infrastructure compatible with MongoDB.
